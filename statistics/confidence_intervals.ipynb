The standard error of the sample mean $\\mathrm{SE}(\\overline{X})$ gives some idea of the spread of the distribution. Can we do better?\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, <b>confidence intervals</b>, constructed from samples drawn from the population, provide a range of values of a random variable $X$. A probability $1-\\alpha$, called the <b>confidence level</b> or <b>confidence coefficient</b>, is associated with this interval. The confidence level is the probability that the provided confidence interval contains the true, but unknown, population parameter $\\theta$ that is being estimated. By the rules of probability, the <b>significance level</b> $\\alpha$ specifies the probability that $\\theta$ lies outside the confidence interval.\n",

    "The goal is to provide and interval estimate of the unknown mean of a population $\\mu$.

In other words, because the population variance $\\sigma^2$ is known, and by extension the sampling distribution variance can be calculated by $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$, it is possible to know the probability associated with various differences of sample means $\\overline{X}$ and the population mean $\\mu$.\n",
