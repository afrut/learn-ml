    "<b>Joint probability distributions</b> can be thought of as a function that gives the probability of encountering different values of two random variables together. For two random continuous variables, their <b>joint probability density function</b>  (joint pdf) $f_{XY}(x, y)$ is a surface; the x and y-axes are different values of the random variables; the z-axis is the probability of encountering the specific $(X=x, Y=y)$ pair.<br>\n",
