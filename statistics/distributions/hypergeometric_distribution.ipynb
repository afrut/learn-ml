    "The <b>Hypergeometric Distribution</b> of a discrete random variable $X$ helps in the following situation. There are 100 balls in a bag. 27 of these balls are blue. If 3 balls are taken from the bag, without replacement, what is the probability of obtaining 2 blue balls? In general terms, there are $N$ objects, $K$ of which are designated as successes. If a sample of size $n$ is drawn from the $N$ objects, what is the probability that the sample contains $x$ successes? Here, $N=100$, $K=27$, $n=3$, and $x=2$.<br>\n",
