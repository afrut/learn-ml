    "Suppose that there are a million balls. Take a sample of 10 balls, measure their diameters, average them and call this average a1. Take another sample of 10, measure, average, and call this a2. Take yet another sample of 10, measure, average, and call this a3. Keep repeating this (many) $n$ times to get $a_n$. If a histogram is made out of the values of $a_n$, the <b>Central Limit Theorem</b> states that this histogram will be approximate the <b>Normal Distribution</b>. In other words, the continuous random varialbe $X$, which are the averages of diameters of samples of size $n=10$, will be normally distributed.<br>\n",
