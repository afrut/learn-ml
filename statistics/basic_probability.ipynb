    "A <b>random experiment</b> can be thought of as executing a trial or procedure. The outcome of this trial varies with each execution even when the trial is performed in the same exact manner every time.\n",

A <b>continuous</b> sample space is one where the possibilities are represented by real numbers. An example is the length of a rod (in m) or the mass of a ball (in kg).\n",
