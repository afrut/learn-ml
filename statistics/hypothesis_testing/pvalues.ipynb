    "P-values are an alternative way of reporting the results of a hypothesis test. Instead of defining a rejection region and an acceptance region, we ask, \"What is the smallest value of the significance level $\\alpha$ that would lead us to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$?\" The answer to this question is simply finding the significance level represented by the sample mean. To find this value:\n",

    "Once the p-value $p$ is computed, deciding on whether to reject the null hypothesis is easy. If the $p < \\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ if $p<\\alpha$. Because of the way the $p$ is computed, $p<\\alpha$ always corresponds to the observed sample mean $\\overline{x}$ being in the critical region."
